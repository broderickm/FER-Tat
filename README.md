Code used to train a Facial Emotion Recognition model to better account for and classify facial tattoos and paintings, with a particular focus on cultural face markings. To do this, a model is trained using multiple cross-cultural emotion databases (AffectNet and JAFFE) and then further supplemented with face image databases that include facial tattoos and painting.
